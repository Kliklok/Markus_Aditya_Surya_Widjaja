<!-- Add your details -->

I am __Markus Aditya Surya Widjaja__, a data analyst trainee/ civil engineer with a newfound interest for an effective and insightful data visualisation. Looking to enter into a more digital and technology-driven field which may or may not be related to civil engineering. I'm a fast and independent learner with experience in project management and capabilities to offer a pragmatic and optimal solution.

I'm doing some data related projects to slowly build my portfolio.

#### Visualisation and data wrangling projects

###### Formula One: Track & Thrill
A simple passion project on visualising Formula One data to find out where the most exciting race locations are. For fans, teams and drivers alike.<br>
Tools used: Python (Pandas), Power BI<br>
Dataset: Kaggle.com<br>

The charts below visualise the data of F1 races between 2017 season to 2021 season (up to Austrian GP) by using a slicer for race year. The dataset itself contains race results from 1950 to 2021. <br>

Learning points: Wrangling the data frame too much makes the visualisation in Power BI inflexible as the relation between the aggregated values and the different IDs is lost
On the other hand, Power BI is unable to sort values within partition/groupby column, as the 'Top N' filter function is applied before the data aggregation in the chart i.e. instead of showing the constructor with the highest number of win (Top N=1) for each circuit, it is showing the constructor with the highest number of win (Top N=1) throughout ALL circuits and then, its number of win for each respective circuit.
